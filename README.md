# Some ground rules
  if you haven't probably read the license before using the program as your could be using it for the wrong purpose
  
  and also before you use the program probably look at a arctic fox images or with the anime Tag because your weird.
  
  This must not be used for botting or "scapling" or Any form of reselling for profit
